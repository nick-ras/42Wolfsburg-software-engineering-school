## Projects Overview
### C Projects

- **Libft**: A custom implementation of various standard C library functions.
- **Get_next_line**: A function that reads a line from a file descriptor.
- **Printf**: A custom implementation of the `printf` function for formatting output.
- **Born2beroot (not in Github)**: A project focused on setting up and managing a Linux server.
- **Push_swap**: Sorting algorithms to efficiently order a stack of integers.
- **So_long**: A simple 2D game where the player navigates through a map to collect items.
- **Philosophers**: A project focused on concurrency and multithreading, simulating philosophers trying to eat while avoiding deadlock.
- **Pipex**: A project that implements piping between processes in a Linux shell, simulating piping between commands like in bash.
- **MiniShell**: Implementation of a simple shell in C++ that supports common shell commands and operations.

### C++ Projects

- **CPP Modules**: Object-oriented programming concepts in C++ including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.



## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/42-core-projects.git
   cd 42-core-projects

## Install Dependencies: 
For C projects, you may need a C compiler like gcc or clang. For C++ projects, ensure you have a C++ compiler like g++.

For C Projects:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc

```
For C++ Projects:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
```
