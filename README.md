## Projects Overview

### C Projects
1. **Libft**: A custom implementation of various standard C library functions.
2. **Get_next_line**: A function that reads a line from a file descriptor.
3. **Printf**: A custom implementation of the `printf` function for formatting output.
4. **Born2beroot (not in Github)**: A project focused on setting up and managing a Linux server.
5. **Push_swap**: Sorting algorithms to efficiently order a stack of integers.
6. **So_long**: A simple 2D game where the player navigates through a map to collect items.
7. **Philosophers**: A project focused on concurrency and multithreading, simulating philosophers trying to eat while avoiding deadlock.
8. **Pipex**: A project that implements piping between processes in a Linux shell, simulating piping between commands like in bash.

### C++ Projects
1. **CPP Modules**: Object-oriented programming concepts in C++ including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.
2. **MiniShell**: Implementation of a simple shell in C++ that supports common shell commands and operations.
